[xsbt.org](http://xsbt.org/) is a very simple website for those who 
are having a hard time remembering where you can download sbt binaries.

You can either download it from the website directly via HTTP / FTP
or use a redirect link which will always redirect you to one of the
original repositories.

The website is running on the [Lift](http://liftweb.net) framework
with all the code and graphics freely available on GitHub.
